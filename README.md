### Procedural Raven Asset (Blender + Unity)  
- Modeled, rigged, and animated a raven with a full flight cycle.  
- Scripted **Blender Python tools** for **procedural feathers + textures**, reducing each feather from thousands of polygons to a single plane for real-time performance.  
- Exported into Unity for animation cycles and testing.
