## Featured Projects

### Planetary FPS Controller (Unity/C#) 
- Implemented **custom gravity** on a spherical planet.  
- Used **quaternions + Euler rotations** for smooth orientation and camera alignment.

### Procedural Raven Asset (Blender + Unity)  
- Modeled, rigged, and animated a raven with a full flight cycle.  
- Scripted **Blender Python tools** for **procedural feathers + textures**, reducing each feather from thousands of polygons to a single plane for real-time performance.  
- Exported into Unity for animation cycles and testing.
- *[ArtStation link coming soon]*
